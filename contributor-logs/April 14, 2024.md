## Changes Made to CSS Code

### CSS Styles - Before Changes
- Defined styles using inline `<style>` tags within the HTML document.
- Used basic CSS properties for layout, typography, and colors.
- Styles lacked modularity and organization, making them difficult to maintain and extend.
- Did not utilize any CSS preprocessors or external libraries.

### Layout and Responsiveness - Before Changes
- Layout was fixed-width and not responsive to different screen sizes.
- No media queries were used to adjust the layout based on screen size.
- The layout consisted of header, aside, and main sections without clear grid-based structure.

### CSS Styles - After Changes
- Refactored styles into an external CSS file (`styles.css`) for better separation of concerns.
- Utilized CSS variables (`--clr-primary`, `--clr-secondary`, etc.) for easy color management.
- Adopted a more modern and consistent design system using the Inter font family from Google Fonts.
- Improved readability and maintainability of the CSS code by grouping related styles and using comments.

### Layout and Responsiveness - After Changes
- Implemented a grid-based layout using CSS Grid for better organization and responsiveness.
- Added media queries to adjust the layout and styles for different screen sizes (1440px, 1230px, 1080px, and 1010px).
- Updated the layout to be more flexible and adapt to various screen sizes, including smaller devices like mobile phones.

### Additional Changes
- Introduced hover effects for better user interaction, such as changing colors for buttons and key-value pairs.
- Improved accessibility by ensuring proper contrast and font sizes for different elements.
- Organized CSS properties and selectors according to their relevance and specificity.


## Changes Made to JavaScript Code

### Before Changes:
- Used separate div elements for keys and values.
- Key input field was a text area, value input was a text area.
- Key-value pairs were displayed within a single div.
- Editing involved directly manipulating the DOM elements.
- The code was structured with some comments explaining the functionality.

### After Changes:
- Introduced separate div elements for keys and values.
- Key input field and value input field are input elements.
- Each key-value pair is wrapped within its own div.
- Editing now involves modifying input values directly.
- The code is still structured similarly, with some improvements and reorganization.

### Key Changes:
1. **Element Structure:**
   - Introduced a separate `valueArea` div for values.
   - Each key-value pair is now contained within a `pair` div.
2. **Input Fields:**
   - Changed key and value input fields to `input` elements for simplicity.
   - Added placeholders for input fields to provide guidance.
3. **Display Area:**
   - Key-value pairs are now displayed within separate `div` elements for better organization.
   - Added a container div for edit and delete buttons.
4. **Editing Functionality:**
   - Editing now involves modifying input values directly rather than manipulating DOM elements.
   - Save function is now more streamlined, directly updating the JSON array and display.

### Additional Notes:
- Comments have been updated to reflect the changes.
- Code is more structured and follows better naming conventions.
- Functionality remains largely the same but with improved readability and maintainability.
